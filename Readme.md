# Dot NET Templates
## Introduction
I use templates to create new projects. This is a collection of templates I use. All should be on:
- .NET 8
- Last version of C#, -ish
- Last version of Nuget packages
- TRIED to use best practices
- Shall have a README.md file with instructions on how to use the template

## Default Templates
The idea is to NOT touch them after installation. I will not use them, but I will keep them for reference.
Nothing has been changed. 

- Default Blazor Server App
- Default Blazor WebAssembly Standalone App
	- I added PWA support (progressive web application)
- Default Console App
- Default Azure Functions
	- Renamed http function
	- Added Timer function
- Default Blazor Modern App
	- With Auto
